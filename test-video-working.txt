Since the video page requires authentication, let me commit the changes and create a comprehensive report for the user. The fixes are in place to:

1. Always fetch signed URLs for S3 videos (even if marked as public)
2. Handle both S3 and local videos properly3. Fix the API route to not check S3 URLs as if they were local files

These changes should fix the video playback issues.
